This act symbolized the founding of the wine company Sartori - and wine has ever been the Sartori family call. More than 100 years have passed since its founding and today it is the 4th generation of the Sartori family that owns and manages the company. This white wine is produced from 100% Garganega grapes grown on Sartori's own vineyards in the Veneto area of ​​Italy. The grapes are hand-picked and carefully selected and have been dry for 40 days - the same method used for the Amarone wines, therefore called Marani 'The White Amarone'",
